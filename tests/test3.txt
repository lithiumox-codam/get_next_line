The program was written in Python, a language he was well-versed in, but for some reason, this specific line of code was giving him trouble. He had tried everything he could think of, from rewriting the line from scratch to searching online forums for similar issues, but nothing seemed to work.

John's frustration was growing by the minute. He knew that he was close to finding the solution, but it was just out of reach. He felt like giving up, like throwing in the towel and moving on to something else, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. He had invested so much time and effort into this program, and he couldn't bear the thought of failing.John's frustration was growing by the minute.

Days turned into weeks, and John's mental and physical health were both deteriorating. He was losing weight, his eyes were bloodshot, and he was barely sleeping. He knew he needed to take a break, but he couldn't bring himself to leave his desk. He was consumed by the program, and nothing else mattered.

Finally, one night, after days of staring at the same lines of code, John had an epiphany. He realized that he had been approaching the problem from the wrong angle. He had been trying to fix the line of code, but what he needed to do was rework the entire function.
